When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  
  In any of the following cases:
  1. Want a remote copy of my content as backup.
  2. When I am collaborating with others on a common project.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	1. Save network bandwidth.
	2. Collaboration can cause frequent conflicts if updating automatically.
	3. Is more natural & simple to ---
		Get what you need. Change it. Update the remote copy.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

	Forks -- clones on GitHub machines. 
		Include additional mechanism to:
		1. track number of forks for each repo.
		2. link to source repo

	Clone -- copy of a repository

	Branch -- is a label to a commit.

	I would use forks when:
	1. I don't have permissions to change the original repo.
	2. I'd like to make modifications to a repo but leave the original repo 
	   intact. 
	3. When I want to indicate my code builds on a different repo and link to 
	   it.


	I would use clones when I'd like to make local copies of my repo. 
	either from remote or local repo. as source.


	I would use branch when I would like to start a new feature / experiment 
	with the state of the code.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

	Work offline. Enables merge with any updates in remote.
