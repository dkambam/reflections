When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  
  In any of the following cases:
  1. Want a remote copy of my content as backup.
  2. When I am collaborating with others on a common project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	1. Save network bandwidth.
	2. Collaboration can cause frequent conflicts if updating automatically.
	3. Is more natural & simple to ---
		Get what you need. Change it. Update the remote copy.
