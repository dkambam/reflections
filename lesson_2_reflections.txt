What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates a metadata folder in the folder to make repository form the 
	current folder. This would setup git to start tracking files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is a seperate conceptual space that contains a subset or all of
	the files from the current working directory. It is part of the repository 
	as a part of it's metadata. It is useful to select & collect a subset of 
	files from the working directory and commit them seperately (i.e) it allows 
	us the option of commiting a subset of files and not all of them.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Add only the file(s) with a particular logical change to the staging area. Then commit the changes in the staging area. This ensures we have one logical change per commit.
